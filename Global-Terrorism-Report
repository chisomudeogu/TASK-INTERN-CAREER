📊 Internship Chronicles: Navigating Global Terrorism Data with Power BI

Thrilled to showcase the results of my second project during my internship at InternCareer. 🚀 This time, I delved into the Global Terrorism Data, a dataset with 180,132 rows, dissecting it to extract meaningful insights.

Data Wrangling:
Trimming down to essentials - Year, Country, Region, Success Rate, Attack Type, Target Type, Target Nationality, Group Name, and Region Name. Cleaned inconsistencies, eliminated blanks, and fine-tuned spellings for precision.

Visual Storytelling:
Unveiling the narrative through key performance indicators (KPIs):
- Success Rate by Attack Type
- Success Rate by Target Type
- Success Rate by Weapon Type
- Success Rate by Country
- Success Rate by Region
- Success Rate by Group Name
- Total Attacks by Year

Interactive Features:
Crafted a dynamic slicer for seamless filtering by country. Highlighted key insights with cards:
- Most Used Weapon
- Total Targets
- Maximum Attacks in a Year
- Most Deadly Group

Heartfelt gratitude to InternCareer for the invaluable learning opportunities. Looking forward to applying these skills in future endeavors! 🌐
